# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!

Is a single webpage containing a game of chance, scripted using Javascript. The game will allow the user to select an option, and then randomly generate a computer response and display the overall outcome and increment scores accordingly. The webpage is fully responsive, and can be used on a number of devices.

## Features

The current features that have been implemented onto the webpage, with potential future features that may be added at a later date.

### Current Features

- __Title and Main Buttons__
    - Located at the top of the page, shows the user the game name, and selection that they can make to start the game.

- __Game Result__
    - As the user selects an option, the left image will change to that of an icon of their selection. The right image will then show the computer choice. Underneath that will be the outcome of the two choices.

- __Scoring__
    - Depending on the outcome of the game, the scores will then be incremented accordingly. Tie games do not increase either score.

### Future Features

- __'Best out of'__
    - Would look to add a 'Best out of' system to the game, to determine an overall winner. This would be set to a level by the user, so they could make the game as short or long as they want. Also would include a reset button, so they can restart the game as and when they wanted.

## Testing

The webpage was tested on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari on iPhone 12. Each time the page was tested for responsiveness, and functionality. Reponsiveness was tested by reducing screen width and ensuring the display was still user friendly, and easy to read without distorting the overall webpage. Functionality was tested by ensuring all buttons worked as expected. Checked that all possible outcomes were outputted correctly, and scores incremented as should be.

During this testing, scripting for the functions of the game was initially done with a switch statement. While this worked to a degree, it was not effective for displaying the relevant image for user and computer selections. This resulted in change in scripting, using 'If' statements based on the absolute truth of the user selection.
